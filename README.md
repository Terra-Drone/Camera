# Camera
Camera API assignment. Kudos to foysalit for providing the tutorial found here:

Code ended up looking too similar but I don't know how to edit it without breaking it aside from changing the variable name.

Included is my initial attempt in cam api (initial build) which had some async problems and can't take pictures yet.
